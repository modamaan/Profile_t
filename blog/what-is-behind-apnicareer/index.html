              <p>Getting mentored with Industry Experts is a vital thing for a tech enthusiast. And we Aswin, Arjun, Chetan, and myself got that oppurtunity to get mentored by Shri. Srikanth Venkatachari, Product and Competency Manager - Tata Elxsi.</p>
              <h2>About the author</h2>
              <p>Arjun Sadashiv is a student at the Amrita School of Engineering, who aspires to work in the field of robotics. He is currently apprenticing under Mr. V. Srikant and trying his level-best in college to achieve his dream.<code style="background-color:yellowgreen;"> He has studied in various schools in different states in India and has also stayed abroad in Qatar, this has made him a people</code> person who loves learning about new things and new people.</p>
              <h2>About the Creator</h2>
              <p>Akhil S Kumar is a student of Amrita School of Engineering, who is a Open Source Enthusiast works with different tech stacks in the fied of Computer Science. He is mainly focusing on Machine Learning & Deep Learning apart from that he is familier with React, Django, GraphQL, UI/UX Design. He also done an Internship at Indian Space Research Organisation, worked on a project Feature Identification in Remote Sensing Data.</p>
              <h2>Day 1</h2>
              <p>This was one the first days of an induction-like program where our mentor ingratiated himself with us. Introductions were made by mentor and apprentices alike, aspirations were discussed. Our mentor gave us three questions that we had to answer honestly. After the first round of answers felt too generalized and manufactured, the mentor told us to be honest to ourselves and to say what truly feels right. He told us to tackle the first question again and each of us did. The question was, “List any three things about you.” Ashwin regaled us with a tale from his childhood in which he went against the herd mindset. Akhil talked passionately about his goal of joining the Army, and listed a few of his creative accomplishments i.e., his YouTube channel and also mentioned that he is familiar with being fiscally responsible. Arjun talked from personal experiences about how he is able to view a problem from different sides and also talked about his passion, Robotics. Chetan talked about his expertise at handling different situations and also talked about the sharing of knowledge. On tackling the first question itself, the session time was over and so goodbyes were said and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
              <h2>Day 2</h2>
              <p>On the second day of the introduction, it was much more relaxed and much did not transpire. A formal introduction was done once again by the apprentices and a doubt clearance session was triggered by Akhil asking about an industry-related question. Conversation about speed detection camera working on roads was engaged. The mentor had let the apprentices know that the mentorship program would come into full swing from the next session and told the students to prepare a Resume which will be evaluated by the mentor and advice will be given as such, regarding the resumes, general interview questions and how to tackle them.</p>
